# Optimization of Marketing Campaigns through Predictive Modeling and Advanced Statistical Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to optimize the efficiency of marketing campaigns by leveraging customer behavior data to predict responses to product or service offers. The project involves developing a predictive model and using advanced statistical methods to derive insights that inform effective segmentation of advertising campaigns.

## Project Description

The project uses customer data from five previous marketing campaigns, including various customer attributes and their responses to previous campaigns. The data is then analyzed to identify patterns and correlations that can inform future marketing strategies.

Key findings from the project include:

* A significant correlation between customer income and spending, suggesting a target demographic for advertising campaigns.
* The independence of customer education and marital status, implying the potential for separate advertising strategies for different customer segments.
* The most successful advertising campaign was the most recent one, particularly in Mexico where it achieved a >60% acceptance rate.
* The most successful products are wines and meats, whereas deals and catalog purchases are the underperforming channels.
* The project also involved hypothesis testing to answer key business questions, such as the average salary of PhD owners compared to Master owners, and the correlation between the annual income and the amount of spending.

The project was coded in Python using Jupyter notebook.

## Technologies

* Python 3.6+
* Jupyter notebook
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Setup

To run this project, install the above-mentioned technologies, clone the repository, and run the Jupyter notebook.

## How to use?

After setting up the environment, open the Jupyter notebook and run each cell to understand the data analysis, model building, and results. Make sure the necessary data files are in the correct directory or update the path in the notebook accordingly.
